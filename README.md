**To Play**
A target number is randomly chosen by the computer between 19 and 120. The object of the game is for the user to match their score to the target score. They do this by clicking on crystals. Each crystal is assigned a hidden value between 1 and 12. The user won't know the value until they click on a crystal and see how it affects their score. If you match the score, wins are increased by one. If you overshoot the target number, losses are increased by one.
